Open in solution Visual Studio, hit build the solution and enjoy ...

The solution has been configured to restore missing NuGet packages, so it should "just work", but in case it does not, you will need to manually install the DocumentDB NuGet package. To do this, open the NuGet package console on the solution and select the "Restore" button top left.

If the button is not there, then just manually search for the package (DocumentDB) and install it.

Before you can run any of the samples you do need an active Azure DocumentDB account. 
So head over to [Azure](http://portal.azure.com) and sign-up for your account.
