# Capture through diagnostic trace listener
Traces are emitted with DocDBTrace source. Below sample app.config configuration captures the traces to a text listener

```xml
<system.diagnostics>
    <switches>
      <add name="SourceSwitch" value="Verbose"/>
    </switches>
    <sources>
      <source name="DocDBTrace" switchName="SourceSwitch" switchType="System.Diagnostics.SourceSwitch" >
        <listeners>
          <add name="MyTextListener" type="System.Diagnostics.TextWriterTraceListener" traceOutputOptions="DateTime,ProcessId,ThreadId" initializeData="CosmosDBTrace.txt"></add>
       < /listeners>
      </source>
    </sources>
  </system.diagnostics> 
```

Please note that tracing everything will impact the application performance. Be selective and is possible collect them only when required. 


# Capture the .net SDK trace in ETL file

The Azure Cosmos DB .NET SDK (from version 1.11.0) support capturing trace in ETL trace log file. The trace is emitted and captured using Windows ETW with very little overhead.

## Method 1: (Recommended) Use Perfview to collect and view ETL.

### Steps to collect and viewETL trace file.

1. Download Perfview tool at  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=28567
2. In Windows command prompt:
   ```cmd
   perfview.exe /onlyproviders=B30ABF1C-6A50-4F2B-85C4-61823ED6CF24:*:0  collect
   ```
3. When it is done, click  “Stop Collection” button.  “PerviewData.etl.zip” will be generated in the current directory.
4. To view the trace,  double Click the PerviewData.etl.zip, go to Events, and look for "Providers/B30ABF1C-6A50-4F2B-85C4-61823ED6CF24"

### Monitor the trace in real time.

1. In Windows command prompt:
   ```cmd
   perfview.exe UserCommand Listen B30ABF1C-6A50-4F2B-85C4-61823ED6CF24:*:0
   ```
## Method 2: Use logman and svcperf to collect and view ETL.

### Steps to collect ETL trace file.

1. In Windows command prompt:
   ```cmd
   logman create trace cosmosdbclienttrace -rt -nb 500 500 -bs 40 -p {B30ABF1C-6A50-4F2B-85C4-61823ED6CF24} -o cosmosdbclient.etl -ft 10
   ```
2. When you are ready to collect trace:
   ```cmd
   logman start cosmosdbclienttrace
   ```
3. When finish collecting:
   ```cmd
   logman stop cosmosdbclienttrace
   ```
4. You should see cosmosdbclientxxx.etl in current directory.

### Steps to open ETL if you are interested:
 1.  Download the svcperf at [https://svcperf.codeplex.com/](https://svcperf.codeplex.com/)
 2.  Open svcperf.exe.
 3.  In "Manifests|Add", add the ClientEvents.man found in this folder with this 
 4.  Open the etl file you have captured, you might need to hit F5 to refresh it.

## You can send the ETL file to the Cosmos DB team for analysis. 


# Removing DefaultTraceListener
By default DefaultTraceListener is included and also not threadsafe (more overhead).
To remove DefaultTraceListener please use below configurationo on app.config

```xml
<configuration>
  <system.diagnostics>
    <sources>
      <source name="DocDBTrace" switchName="SourceSwitch" switchType="System.Diagnostics.SourceSwitch" >
        <listeners>
          <clear/>
        </listeners>
      </source>
    </sources>
  </system.diagnostics> 
<configuration>
```

### NOTE: app.config is only supported in .NET FX not .NET core.
